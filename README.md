# RiskQuant: Financial Risk Modeling Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
**RiskQuant** is a project focused on developing machine learning models to assess the financial risk of portfolios or individual assets. This project is designed to help actuarial and quantitative finance students, practice and improve their quantitative skills, specifically in the area of risk assessment.

The primary objective is to build models that can measure and predict portfolio risks using techniques such as Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall, and machine learning-based approaches like Random Forests and Bayesian methods. This project is structured to provide insights into risk metrics that are critical for portfolio management and financial decision-making.

## Project Goals
1. **Implement Traditional Risk Metrics**: Calculate Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) based on historical data.
2. **Machine Learning for Risk Prediction**: Build machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, Bayesian models) to predict financial risks.
3. **Compare and Validate**: Compare traditional and machine learning approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` & `numpy`: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
  - `scikit-learn`: To build and evaluate machine learning models.
  - `statsmodels`: For statistical models and analysis.
  - `PyMC3` or `TensorFlow Probability`: For Bayesian analysis and probabilistic programming.
- **Data**: Historical financial data from sources such as Yahoo Finance, Quandl, or other market data providers.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Folder to store raw and processed datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and initial modeling.
- **models/**: Trained models and model evaluation results.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Project overview and documentation.
